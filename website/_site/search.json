The Context Loss\nProblem: AI agents lose context between prompts, leading to inconsistent or contradictory outputs.\nSolution: SpecFlow maintains context through structured documentation and progressive refinement.\n\n\n3. The Coordination Challenge\nProblem: Multiple AI interactions often produce fragmented, incompatible pieces.\nSolution: SpecFlow provides a roadmap that ensures all pieces work together toward a unified goal.\n\n\n4.
