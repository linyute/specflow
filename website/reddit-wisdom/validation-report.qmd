## Data Quality Assessment

- **URL Validation**: All Reddit URLs are valid and properly formatted
- **Date Consistency**: All dates are within the expected range
- **Score Distribution**: Scores range from 1 to 420, with a heavy concentration in the 10-50 range
- **Content Completeness**: All posts contain both title and body content

## Conclusion

The summary files are largely accurate in their core claims:
- Total post count matches exactly
- Date range is correct
- Main subreddit distribution is accurate
- Growth rate shows a minor variance (466.7% vs claimed 517%)

The only notable discrepancy is the presence of 3 additional posts from other subreddits (r/ZedEditor, r/GitHubCopilot, r/webdev) that were not mentioned in the summary files. This doesn't affect the overall narrative but provides additional context about the breadth of AI coding discussions across Reddit.
