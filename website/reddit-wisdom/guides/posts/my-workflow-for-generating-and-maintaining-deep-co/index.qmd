Hey r/cursor!

I've been working with Cursor on large modular projects and wanted to share a workflow I've developed for generating comprehensive context documentation that makes AI assistance much more effective.

### The Problem

When you're deep in complex projects with multiple modules, giving Cursor (or any AI) enough context is a real headache. You usually end up with:

- Insufficient context → Useless AI suggestions
- Too much irrelevant context → Confused AI, wasted tokens
- Manual context prep → Time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent

### My Solution: Semi-Automated Context Generation

### Step 1: Create Analysis Templates

In the root of each module, I create an `ai_module_update.md`file. This file is essentially a detailed prompt for an LLM. Here's the template:

    Analyze the structure and all significant files of this project module comprehensively and create a .md file with all information about this module's functionality that would be useful for AI to quickly understand the essence and structure of the module.
    
    ## Must include in analysis:
    1. Module name: [MODULE_NAME_HERE] // e.g., Admin Panel (Vue.js)
    2. Purpose and business logic: Main purpose, what business problems it solves
    3. Working logic: How the module functions overall, main processes and algorithms
    4. File and folder structure: Hierarchy and organization of module files
    5. Database table structure: Analysis based on migrations
    6. Tech stack and library versions: Technologies, frameworks, libraries used
    7. Architecture and code organization style: Design patterns, code organization approaches
    8. Module routes: All routes, their purpose and controller connections
    9. Controllers and their meaning: Analysis of all controllers and their methods
    10. Module services and their logic: Description of all service classes and functionality
    11. Interaction with other modules: How the module integrates with the rest of the project
    
    ## Analysis instructions:
    - You can request any necessary context without limitations through available search and file analysis tools
    - Keep requesting information until everything is absolutely clear to you
    - Pay special attention to key files that define the module's working logic
    - If you encounter complex or non-obvious code parts, analyze them in detail
    
    ## File paths for analysis:
    - [LIST_RELEVANT_PATHS_HERE] // e.g., /src/Components/Admin, /src/Components/Blog

### Step 2: Generate Documentation

I feed this template to Claude or Gemini (btw Gemini Flash handles this straightforward task very well and quickly) and get a comprehensive `ai_module_summary.md` file that I save in the module root.

### Step 3: Project-Level Documentation

I create a similar `ai_project_update.md` in the project root that references all module summaries, then generate an `ai_project_summary.md`.

### Step 4: Configure Cursor

Add these lines to `.cursorignore`:

    **/ai_module_update.md
    **/ai_project_update.md

This prevents Cursor from getting confused by the update instructions while keeping the summary files available.

### Usage

- **Module context**: Include the specific `ai_module_summary.md` when working on that module
- **Global context**: Include `ai_project_summary.md` for cross-module work
- **Updates**: Periodically regenerate summaries when functionality changes significantly

### Benefits

✅ **Consistent context**: Every module gets the same thorough analysis  
✅ **Time-saving**: Generate once, use many times  
✅ **Scalable**: Works for projects with dozens of modules  
✅ **Up-to-date**: Easy to regenerate when code changes  
✅ **Focused**: Cursor gets exactly the context it needs

### Example Use Case

When I need to add a feature that touches the Blog module, I just include blog's `ai_module_summary.md` in my Cursor prompt. The AI immediately understands the module's structure, database schema, routes, and business logic without me having to manually explain anything.

Has anyone else tried similar approaches?

**TL;DR**: Created template files that generate comprehensive module documentation via AI, then feed those summaries to Cursor for much better context awareness in modular projects.
