## Post Content

I’ve built a Cursor extension that guides you step by step in building apps from scratch with AI. It’s designed to help you learn coding with Cursor in a practical way.

The extension doesn’t just provide instructions but also interacts with Cursor’s chat.

Right now, there are four projects you can implement with the extension:

1. Real-Time Camera Filter App – A simple browser-based application that accesses your camera and applies Instagram-like filters to photos or video streams in real time.

1. Console Chat with LLM – A “Hello, World!”-style project where you build a simple console application to chat with an LLM.

1. Agent “All Dry” – A fun project that teaches you how to build an image-processing app using a diffusion model and an AI agent

1. Zendesk Support Helper – A practical project where you build an AI assistant that suggests answers to Zendesk tickets based on previous data using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This could be especially useful for customer support.

More projects are on the way.

You can find the extension on the marketplace (it's free): [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ai-dl.enlighter) 

I’d really appreciate any feedback on both the extension itself and the content. Let me know what you think!
