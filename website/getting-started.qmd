## Welcome to Specflow

This guide will walk you through your first Specflow project. By the end, you'll understand how to transform a vague idea into a well-executed software project using AI assistance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- Access to an AI coding assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- A development environment for your chosen language
- 30-60 minutes for your first project
- An open mind about planning before coding

## The Five Phases of Specflow

## Phase 1: Intent - Define Your Goal (10-15 minutes)

**What & Why** - Start with clarity about what you're building and why it matters.

### Step 1.1: Define Your Vision

Start by answering these questions:

1. **What do I want to build?**
   - Be specific but not overly technical
   - Focus on outcomes, not implementation

2. **Why does this need to exist?**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who will benefit?

3. **What does success look like?**
   - How will you know it's working?
   - What are the key features?

### Step 1.2: Document Your Intent

Create an intent document. Here's a template:

```markdown
# Project Intent: [Your Project Name]

## Vision
[1-2 sentences describing what you're building]

## Problem Statement
[What problem are you solving?]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

## Constraints
- Technical: [Any technical limitations]
- Time: [Deadline or time budget]
- Resources: [Available tools/people]

## Non-Goals
[What this project will NOT do]
```

### Example: Weather Dashboard

```markdown
# Project Intent: Personal Weather Dashboard

## Vision
A clean, minimalist web dashboard that shows weather 
information for multiple cities I care about.

## Problem Statement
I check weather for multiple cities daily (home, 
office, parents' city) across different apps. 
I want one unified view.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Shows current weather for 3+ cities
- [ ] Updates automatically every 30 minutes
- [ ] Works on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Loads in under 2 seconds

## Constraints
- Technical: Use free weather APIs only
- Time: Complete in one weekend
- Resources: Solo developer, modern web stack

## Non-Goals
- No user accounts or personalization
- No weather history or predictions beyond 5 days
- No native mobile apps
```

## Phase 2: Roadmap - Plan Your Phases (10-15 minutes)

**Milestones** - Break your vision into manageable phases with clear goals.

### Step 2.1: Identify Major Phases

Break your project into 3-5 major phases:

1. **Foundation**: Core setup and structure
2. **Core Features**: Essential functionality
3. **Enhancement**: Polish and improvements
4. **Deployment**: Making it available

### Step 2.2: Create Your Roadmap

For each phase, define:
- **Goal**: What this phase accomplishes
- **Deliverables**: Concrete outputs
- **Dependencies**: What must come first

### Example Roadmap: Weather Dashboard

```markdown
# Weather Dashboard Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (2 hours)
**Goal**: Set up project structure and basic UI
**Deliverables**:
- Project scaffold (React/Next.js)
- Basic component structure
- Simple styling system
**Dependencies**: None

## Phase 2: Weather Integration (3 hours)
**Goal**: Connect to weather API and display data
**Deliverables**:
- Weather API integration
- City weather components
- Auto-refresh mechanism
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

## Phase 3: Multi-City Support (2 hours)
**Goal**: Support multiple cities elegantly
**Deliverables**:
- City management system
- Responsive grid layout
- Local storage for preferences
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

## Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (1 hour)
**Goal**: Refine UI and deploy to production
**Deliverables**:
- Loading states and error handling
- Final UI polish
- Deployed to Vercel/Netlify
**Dependencies**: Phase 3 complete
```

## Phase 3: Tasks - Break It Down (5-10 minutes per phase)

**Human + AI** - Convert roadmap items into specific tasks, optimally distributed between you and AI.

### Step 3.1: Break Down Each Phase

For each roadmap phase, create specific tasks:

1. **Make tasks atomic** (completable in one session)
2. **Define clear outputs** (what "done" looks like)
3. **Assign to human or AI** (based on strengths)

### Step 3.2: Create Task Lists

Use this format:

```markdown
## Phase 1 Tasks: Foundation

### Task 1.1: Project Setup [AI-Assisted]
- Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- Set up ESLint and Prettier
- Create folder structure
- Output: Working development environment

### Task 1.2: Component Architecture [Human]
- Design component hierarchy
- Create component interfaces
- Set up props types
- Output: Component structure diagram

### Task 1.3: Base Components [AI-Assisted]
- Create Layout component
- Create WeatherCard component shell
- Create CityGrid component
- Output: Basic component files
```

## Phase 4: Execute - Build Together

**Systematic** - Work through tasks methodically with your AI partner.

### Step 4.1: Prepare Your AI Assistant

Start each AI session with context:

```
I'm building a weather dashboard using Specflow methodology.

Current Status:
- Phase: 1 (Foundation)
- Task: 1.1 (Project Setup)

Intent Summary:
[Paste your intent document summary]

Task Details:
[Paste specific task details]

Please help me complete this task.
```

### Step 4.2: Execute Systematically

1. **Complete tasks in order** (respect dependencies)
2. **Verify each output** (matches task definition?)
3. **Document decisions** (for context preservation)
4. **Commit frequently** (maintain progress)

### Step 4.3: Effective AI Prompting

Good Specflow prompts include:

- **Context**: Where you are in the project
- **Specific ask**: What you need right now
- **Constraints**: Any limitations or preferences
- **Output format**: How you want the response

Example:

```
I'm in Phase 2, Task 2.1 of my weather dashboard project.
I need to integrate the OpenWeatherMap API.

Requirements:
- Use fetch API (no axios)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return normalized data structure
- Include TypeScript types

Please create a weather service module.
```

## Phase 5: Refine - Iterate & Learn

**Improve** - Review outputs against intent and continuously improve.

### Step 5.1: Regular Check-ins

After each phase, ask:

1. **Does output match intent?** (Refer to original vision)
2. **What did we learn?** (New constraints or opportunities)
3. **Should we adjust the roadmap?** (Based on learnings)

### Step 5.2: Iterate Intelligently

- **Small adjustments**: Update task details
- **Medium changes**: Revise phase goals
- **Large pivots**: Revisit intent document

## Your First Specflow Project

### Suggested Starter Projects

Choose based on your experience level:

**Beginner**: Personal Todo CLI
- 4-6 hours total
- Clear requirements
- Limited scope

**Intermediate**: Markdown Blog Generator
- 8-12 hours total
- File processing
- Template system

**Advanced**: API Integration Dashboard
- 16-24 hours total
- Multiple data sources
- Real-time updates

### Success Tips

1. **Start small** - Your first project should be completable in a day
2. **Document everything** - Future you will thank present you
3. **Embrace the process** - Planning feels slow but saves time
4. **Iterate freely** - Plans can and should evolve
5. **Celebrate milestones** - Acknowledge each completed phase
