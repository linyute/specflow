## 🚀 What is Specflow?

Specflow is a **structured but flexible process methodology** for building software with AI SWE agents. It transforms the often chaotic process of agent-first development into a systematic, repeatable methodology that consistently delivers results aligned with your vision.

## The Problem

Building software with AI agents today often results in:
- 🎯 **Intent Gap** - What you envision vs. what AI produces
- 💭 **Context Loss** - AI forgets where you are between prompts
- 🧩 **Coordination Chaos** - Fragmented, incompatible outputs
- ⚡ **Efficiency Paradox** - Fast generation, extensive rework

## The Solution

Specflow provides structure through five interconnected phases:

    B --> C[Task<br/>Decomposition]
    C --> D[Collaborative<br/>Execution]
    D --> E[Continuous<br/>Refinement]
    E --> |Iterate| D
