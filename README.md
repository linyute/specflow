## 🚀 What is Specflow?

Specflow is a **structured but flexible process methodology** for building software with AI SWE agents. It transforms the often chaotic process of agent-first development into a systematic, repeatable methodology that consistently delivers results aligned with your vision.

### The Problem

Building software with AI agents today often results in:
- 🎯 **Intent Gap** - What you envision vs. what AI produces
- 💭 **Context Loss** - AI forgets where you are between prompts
- 🧩 **Coordination Chaos** - Fragmented, incompatible outputs
- ⚡ **Efficiency Paradox** - Fast generation, extensive rework

### The Solution

Specflow provides structure through five interconnected phases:

    A[Intent<br/>Capture] --> B[Roadmap<br/>Creation]
    B --> C[Task<br/>Decomposition]
    C --> D[Collaborative<br/>Execution]
    D --> E[Continuous<br/>Refinement]
    E --> |Iterate| D

    style D fill:#e0f2fe
    style E fill:#d1fae5
```

## 📖 The Five Phases

### 1. Intent - Define Your Goal
**What & Why** - Start with clarity about what you're building and why it matters.

### 2. Roadmap - Plan Your Phases  
**Milestones** - Break your vision into manageable phases with clear goals.

### 3. Tasks - Break It Down
**Human + AI** - Convert roadmap items into specific tasks, optimally distributed.

### 4. Execute - Build Together
**Systematic** - Work through tasks methodically with your AI partner.

### 5. Refine - Iterate & Learn
**Improve** - Review outputs against intent and continuously improve.

## 🎯 Who Benefits?

- **👩‍💻 Software Developers** - Build features faster while maintaining quality
- **📊 Product Managers** - Bridge vision and execution effectively
- **🚀 Technical Leaders** - Scale team capacity with AI assistance
- **🤖 AI Enthusiasts** - Master structured prompting techniques
