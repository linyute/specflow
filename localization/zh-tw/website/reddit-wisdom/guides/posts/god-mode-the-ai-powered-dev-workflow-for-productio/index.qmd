## Post Content

I'm a SWE who's spent the last 2 years in a committed relationship with every AI coding tool on the market. The goal: build entire products without needing to write code myself. Yes, I'm that lazy. Yes, it actually works.

### What you need to know first

You don't need to code, but you should at least know what code *is*. Understanding React, Node.js, and basic version control will save you from staring blankly at error messages that might as well be written in hieroglyphics.

Also, know how to use GitHub Desktop. Not because you'll be pushing commits like a responsible developer, but because you'll need somewhere to store all those failed attempts.

### Step 1: Start with Lovable for UI

Lovable creates UIs that make my design-challenged attempts look like crayon drawings. But here's the catch: Lovable is not *that* great for complete apps.

So just use it for static UI screens. Nothing else. No databases. No auth. Just pretty buttons that don't do anything.

### Step 2: Document everything

After connecting to GitHub and cloning locally, I open the repo in Cursor.

First order of business: Have the AI document what we're building. Why? Because these AIs are unable to understand complete requirements, they work best in small steps. 

### Step 3: Build feature by feature

Create a Notion board. List all your features. Then feed them one by one to your AI assistant like you're training a particularly dim puppy.

Always ask for error handling and console logging for every feature. Yes, it's overkill. Yes, you'll thank me when everything inevitably breaks.

For auth and databases, use Supabase. Not because it's necessarily the best, but because it'll make debugging slightly less soul-crushing.

### Step 4: Handling the inevitable breakdown

Expect a 50% error rate. That's not pessimism; that's optimism.

Here's what you need to do:

- Test each feature individually
- Check console logs (you did add those, right?)
- Feed errors back to AI (and pray)

### Step 5: Security check

Before deploying, have a powerful model review your codebase to find all those API keys you accidentally hard-coded. Use RepoMix and paste the results into Claude, O1, whatever. (If there's interest I'll write a detailed guide on this soon. Lmk)

### Why this actually works

The current AI tools won't replace real devs anytime soon. They're like junior developers and mostly need close supervision.

However, they're incredible amplifiers if you have basic knowledge. I can build in days what used to take weeks.

I'm developing an AI tool myself to improve code generation quality, which feels a bit like using one robot to build a better robot. The future is weird, friends.

TL;DR: Use AI builders for UI, AI coding assistants for features, more powerful models for debugging, and somehow convince people you actually know what you're doing. Works 60% of the time, every time.
