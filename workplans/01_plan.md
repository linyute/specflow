# SpecFlow Website Development Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a comprehensive website about **SpecFlow** - a structured pattern for prompting AI agents to build software. The website will serve as both documentation and demonstration of the SpecFlow methodology.

### What is SpecFlow?

SpecFlow is a structured pattern for prompting AI agents to build software that:
- Starts with high-level intent (the idea)
- Breaks it down into a roadmap
- Decomposes that into focused tasks for humans and agents to execute together
- Allows for rapid refinement throughout the process

**Core Philosophy**: Orchestrating intent, step-by-step, from "what we want" to "what gets built."

## Current Quarto Project Status

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Platform**: Quarto website (static site generator)
- **Theme**: Cosmo with custom branding
- **Structure**: Multi-page layout with comprehensive content
- **Build System**: Fully configured with `.quarto/` build cache
