Here is a structured evolution of AI coding "how-to" guides based on the provided Reddit data.

# Evolution of AI Coding How-To Guides

## Phase 1: Foundation (September 2024 - February 2025)

### Overview
This initial period, covering approximately 6 months, focused on establishing the fundamental principles of interacting with AI for coding. The guides from this era moved beyond simple code generation to teach developers how to structure their collaboration with the AI. The dominant themes were establishing a mental model for the AI (e.g., as a role-player or junior dev), setting up basic project rules, and using software development fundamentals like Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a safety net for AI-generated code. The core innovation was the shift from treating the AI as a search engine to treating it as a programmable collaborator.

### Key Guides

#### 1. Role-Playing for Structured Output

- **Target Audience**: Beginner/Intermediate
- **Core Instructions**:
    1.  **Act as a Software Engineer**: "First, ask the AI to be a software engineer. Pass all the relevant files and have it explain the code back to you."
    2.  **Act as a Product Manager**: "Next, put on your product manager hat and ask the AI to do the same. This is where you lay out the new feature you want the AI to develop. Be clear, be specific, and don't be afraid to ask for a product requirement document."
    3.  **Act as a Tech Lead**: "If the feature is a bit on the complex side, consider writing pseudo code first. This gives the AI another opportunity to review the codebase, your requirements, and figure out which files and code sections need to be tweaked."
    4.  **Act as a Developer**: "Finally, ask the AI to write the actual code based on the pseudo code and the understanding gained from the previous steps. Once the coding is done, have the AI generate a git commit message."
- **Tools**: Cursor Editor, Python, FastAPI, Postgres
- **Innovation**: This guide introduced the **role-playing workflow**, a foundational technique where the user assigns different professional personas to the AI to elicit specific types of output (analysis, planning, coding). This was a breakthrough in controlling the AI's behavior.

#### 2. Using TDD and Documentation in Large Projects

- **Target Audience**: Intermediate/Advanced
- **Core Instructions**:
    1.  **Write Code Through Tests First**: "I found a sweet spot with 1-2 integration tests using real credentials. Write one failing test, implement the feature, and get a checkpoint... This creates an efficient AI feedback loop."
    2.  **Break Tasks Into Small Steps**: "Finding the right task size is the most crucial skill... Too big, and the Cursor might go off track... Too small, and you'll spend more time writing tests than solving the actual problem."
    3.  **Preserve Thought Process as Documentation**: "I save all our discussions and decisions in design documents and commit to the code... I can freely start a new chat, add my design doc for context, and continue from any point."
    4.  **Work Exclusively Through Composer Agent**: "The ability to roll back to any point in our dialogue, modify the prompt, automatically restore files to that state, and try again turned out to be incredibly powerful."
- **Tools**: Cursor IDE (Composer Agent), SuperWhisper (Voice Dictation)
- **Innovation**: This guide established best practices for using AI in professional, large-scale projects. It pioneered using **Test-Driven Development (TDD) as an AI feedback loop** and treating **chat history as formal documentation** to maintain context.

## Phase 2: Development (March 2025 - Early May 2025)

### Overview
This period saw an explosion of comprehensive, structured guides. The community codified the "vibe coding" process into detailed, repeatable workflows. The central theme was **context management and explicit instruction**. Guides taught users how to create detailed project rules, provide relevant code examples, and break down complex features into dozens of small, manageable prompts. The "treat it like a junior dev" analogy became the dominant mental model, emphasizing guidance over blind trust.

    2.  **Break the feature into small tasks**: "Each one should be something Cursor can do in a single go."
    3.  **Write clear instructions for each step**: "I include inputs, outputs, and where the code should go."
    4.  **Set up Cursor rules before coding**: "These guide the AI to follow specific patterns in your project."
    5.  **Test each step as soon as it’s built**: "If there’s an issue, I isolate it and rerun the prompt with the specific problem."
    6.  **Keep moving one step at a time**: "I don’t ask it to build a dashboard or backend all at once."
- **Tools**: Cursor, Notion, Devplan
- **Innovation**: This guide popularized the **"junior dev" analogy**, providing a powerful and intuitive mental model that helped users understand *why* clear, step-by-step guidance is necessary for success with AI coding assistants.

## Phase 3: Advanced (Late May 2025 - June 2025)

### Overview
The most recent phase marks a shift towards engineering the development process itself. The guides are highly sophisticated, treating the AI not just as a collaborator but as a programmable agent within a larger system. The focus is on creating scalable, semi-autonomous workflows that can handle immense context and complexity with high fidelity. These guides are targeted at advanced users looking to build production-grade systems powered by AI.

### Key Guides

#### 1. Agentic Project Management
- **Source**: u/Cobuter_Man on r/cursor (score: 35) - [https://reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1l2p2y6/agentic_project_management_my_ai_workflow/](https://reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1l2p2y6/agentic_project_management_my_ai_workflow/)
- **Target Audience**: Advanced
- **Core Instructions**:
    1.  **Initiation Phase**: Use a "Manager Agent" (e.g., Claude 3.7, GPT-4o) with an initiation prompt to understand the project goals and create a detailed Implementation Plan. This plan breaks work into tasks for "Implementation Agents."
    2.  **Main Loop**: The user asks the Manager Agent to create a "Task Assignment Prompt" for the first task. This is pasted into a new chat (the Implementation Agent). The Implementation Agent completes the task, logs its work to a "Dynamic Memory Bank" (a markdown file), and reports back.
    3.  **Review and Iterate**: The user asks the Manager Agent to review the memory log. The Manager then provides a follow-up prompt (e.g., to debug or proceed to the next task).
    4.  **Context Handovers**: When an agent's context window is near its limit, instruct it to perform a "Handover Procedure," creating a `Handover_File.md` and a `Handover_Prompt.md` to seamlessly transfer context to a new agent (a new chat session).
- **Tools**: Cursor (or other AI IDE), High-capability models (Claude 3.7, GPT-4o), Cheaper models for implementation, GitHub.
- **Innovation**: This guide introduces a formal **multi-agent framework** for project management, with distinct roles and communication protocols (memory logs, handover procedures) to overcome context limitations and orchestrate complex work.

#### 2. Anchoring AI Context with Version Control
- **Source**: u/aarontatlorg33k on r/cursor (score: 29) - [https://reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1l00f5y/manifestmd_workflow_statemd_gitshas_god_mode/](https://reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1l00f5y/manifestmd_workflow_statemd_gitshas_god_mode/)
- **Target Audience**: Advanced
- **Core Instructions**:
    1.  **Enable AI Commits**: Instruct Cursor to explicitly make a backup before and after each task, which may trigger it to make a Git commit.
    2.  **Track Commit SHAs**: After each meaningful task is completed, find the Git commit SHA that Cursor (or you) created.
    3.  **Update the Manifest**: Add the GitSHA to your `.cursor/manifest.md` or `workflow_state.md` file, right next to the completed task. (Example: `- [x] Build login form - GITSHA: def5678`).
    4.  **Reference SHAs for Debugging**: When a feature fails or needs revision, use the SHA to jump to the last working state. Instruct the AI to "pick up from that moment" or "use the code from SHA `abc1234` as a reference."
- **Tools**: Cursor, Git
- **Innovation**: This guide presents the novel technique of **integrating Git SHAs into the AI's workflow manifest**. This anchors the AI's understanding to a precise, verifiable point in time, enabling perfect state recall and dramatically improving debugging and regression handling.
