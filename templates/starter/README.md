# Specflow Starter Template

A simple starter approach to implementing the [Specflow methodology](https://specflow.com) for structured software development with AI agents.

## What is Specflow?

[Specflow](https://specflow.com) is an open methodology for building software with AI agents through structured planning and iterative execution. The core philosophy is **"Plan first, act second"** - ensuring every prompt, task, and output serves your goals rather than leading to chaotic, unplanned development.

## Template Overview

This template provide a minimal structured approach to the Specflow process, taking you from initial brainstorming to organized task execution:

### üß† BRAINSTORM.md
**Purpose**: Unstructured idea capture
- Raw thoughts, inspiration, and initial concepts
- No organization required - just dump everything here
- Voice recordings, copy-paste, random ideas welcome
- Foundation for structured planning

### üìã SPEC.md  
**Purpose**: Transform brainstorm into actionable specification
- Guided prompts to define users, needs, and requirements
- Technology stack decisions with AI collaboration
- Clear progression from idea to implementation plan
- Ready for AI coding agents to understand and execute

### ‚úÖ TASKS.md
**Purpose**: Break down spec into manageable development sessions
- Focus on right-sized chunks of work for single AI sessions
- Balance between human planning and AI execution
- Stage-aware development progression
- Session tracking and iteration planning

## The Specflow Process

This template implements the core Specflow methodology:

1. **Intent** (BRAINSTORM.md) ‚Üí Define goal: What & Why
2. **Roadmap** (SPEC.md) ‚Üí Plan phases: Milestones  
3. **Tasks** (TASKS.md) ‚Üí Break down: Human + AI
4. **Execute** ‚Üí Build together: Systematic
5. **Refine** ‚Üí Iterate & learn: Improve

## How to Use This template

### 1. Start with Brainstorming
Open `BRAINSTORM.md` and capture all your ideas without structure:
- What you're trying to build
- Why it matters  
- Problems it solves
- Random inspiration and thoughts

### 2. Create Your Specification
Use `SPEC.md` to organize your thoughts:
- Follow the guided prompts to define users and needs
- Choose your application fidelity level
- Select form factor and technology stack
- Transform brainstorm into clear requirements

### 3. Plan Your Tasks
Use `TASKS.md` for development session planning:
- Break down spec into manageable chunks
- Balance human planning with AI execution
- Track progress and iterate

### 4. Execute with AI
Hand off your polished specs to AI coding agents for implementation, knowing your context and intent are preserved.

## Why Use Structured Templates?

Without structure, AI development often results in:
- ‚ùå Misaligned outputs that don't match your intent
- ‚ùå Wasted time on iterations that miss the mark  
- ‚ùå Fragmented results from uncoordinated efforts
- ‚ùå Lost context between development phases

With Specflow templates:
- ‚úÖ **Structured Planning**: Clear progression from idea to implementation
- ‚úÖ **Human-AI Collaboration**: Optimal task distribution
- ‚úÖ **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement throughout the process
- ‚úÖ **Context Preservation**: Maintain alignment with original intent

## Integration with BearClaude

This template is included with [BearClaude](https://bearclaude.specstory.com), a macOS tool designed for turning specs into software with Claude Code built in. BearClaude provides a focused environment for the upstream work of specifications, reasoning, and structure - making implementation effortless. When you create a new project in BearClaude you can choose to include these template files. 

## Getting Started

1. Copy these template files to your project
2. Start with `BRAINSTORM.md` - dump all your ideas
3. Move to `SPEC.md` when ready to organize
4. Use `TASKS.md` for development session planning
5. Execute with your preferred AI coding agent
